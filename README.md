# This is my Tesla Project

### About my Project
My project is about Tesla cars.  I am inspired about the use of EVs especially in todays world.  I feel strongly about sustainability and would like to support initiatives that encourage moving away from fossil fuels.

I have a few friends who have Teslas and have driven one myself.  I like the minimilistic design in the interior of the vehicles and the range on offer.
